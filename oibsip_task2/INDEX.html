      <h3>Introduction:</h3>
      <p>
        Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Apostle of Peace" and the
        "Father of the Nation" in India, was a towering figure whose life and
        principles shaped the course of history. Born on October 2, 1869, in
        Porbandar, India, he emerged as a symbol of non-violent resistance and
        led India to independence from British colonial rule.
      </p>

      <h3>Early Life and Education:</h3>
      <p>
        Gandhi hailed from a humble background and pursued his early education
        in India. In 1888, he set sail for London to study law, subsequently
        becoming a barrister.
      </p>

      <h3>South Africa and the Birth of Activism:</h3>
      <p>
        Gandhi's life took a transformative turn in South Africa, where he lived
        and worked for over two decades. There, he encountered racial
        discrimination and oppression, kindling his passion for civil rights and
        social justice. It was during this time that he coined the term
        "Satyagraha" to denote his philosophy of non-violent resistance.
      </p>
      <h3>Return to India:</h3>
      <p>
        In 1915, Gandhi returned to India, armed with his philosophy of
        non-violence. He joined the Indian National Congress and began
        organizing campaigns and protests against British colonial rule.
      </p>
      <h3>Salt March and Civil Disobedience:</h3>
      <p>
        The iconic Salt March in 1930 was a watershed moment in India's struggle
        for freedom. Gandhi, along with thousands of followers, walked 240 miles
        to the Arabian Sea to protest the British monopoly on salt production.
        This non-violent act of civil disobedience galvanized millions of
        Indians to join the fight for independence.
      </p>
      <h3>Imprisonment and Sacrifice:</h3>
      <p>
        Gandhi's commitment to non-violence led to numerous imprisonments and
        hunger strikes. His willingness to endure personal suffering for the
        greater good inspired a nation and garnered international attention.
      </p>
      <h3>Achieving Independence:</h3>
      <p>
        Following World War II, the British government recognized the
        impossibility of maintaining control over India. Negotiations for
        independence ensued, and India finally gained its freedom on August 15,
        1947. The culmination of years of peaceful struggle marked a turning
        point in world history.
      </p>
      <h3>Legacy:</h3>
      <p>
        Mahatma Gandhi's legacy extends far beyond India's independence. His
        principles of non-violence, truth, and social justice have left an
        indelible mark on the global stage. Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr.
        and Nelson Mandela drew inspiration from his teachings in their own
        quests for civil rights and equality.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
      <p>
        Mahatma Gandhi's life exemplifies the power of non-violence, moral
        courage, and unwavering commitment to justice. His legacy reminds us
        that positive change can be achieved through peaceful means and that one
        individual's dedication to truth and love can transform the world.
        Gandhi's enduring influence continues to inspire individuals and
        movements worldwide, transcending borders, cultures, and generations.
